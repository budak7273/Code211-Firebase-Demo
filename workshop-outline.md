#Workshop Outline

1. Create a file called `index.html` and paste the contents of `starting-point.html` file on this Github into it.
2. Go to the firebase console website (https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new firebase app with a name of your choice. I suggest you do this from a personal google account rather than a school one so that you don't have to worry about transferring it over when you graduate.
3. Click the Web App Button (looks like this: </> ) and copy the snippet it provides into the `PASTE-HERE` segment of `index.html`
