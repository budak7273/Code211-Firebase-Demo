# Code211-Firebase-Demo
Demo website for the Firebase workshop for Code211 2018-2019.

This was created for the Code211 2018-2019 _Lighting it up with Google Firebase_ workshop. See the website here: https://code211.org

This demo does not need to be hosted with a webserver or anything since it does not use Firebase Authentication. Opening `index.html` in your browser will work just fine.
